        <h2>My Learning Experience</h2>
        <p>Creating this portfolio website has been a challenging but rewarding experience.
            At the beginning of the module, I had very little understanding of how websites
            were structured. Learning HTML was confusing at first, especially remembering
            which tags to use and how pages connect to each other. Over time, this became
            easier as I practiced building different pages and fixing mistakes.</p>

        <p>CSS was one of the hardest parts for me. Small errors could break the entire layout,
            and debugging sometimes took a long time. However, these problems helped me learn
            how important it is to write clean code and test changes step by step. Seeing the
            design finally work as intended was very satisfying and motivated me to continue
            improving.

        <h2>Development of the Website</h2>
       <p>
            At first, the website started as a simple single page with basic text. As the term
            progressed, I expanded it into a multi-page portfolio with consistent navigation.
            I learned how to link pages together, embed videos, create forms, and apply
            responsive design so the site works on both desktop and mobile devices.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using semantic HTML elements such as <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> helped improve the
            structure and accessibility of the website. This also made the code easier to
            read and understand.

        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>
            I chose a simple and clean design to keep the website easy to use and professional.
            Neutral colours and readable fonts were selected so users can focus on the content
            without distraction. The layout was influenced by modern portfolio websites that
            use clear navigation and minimal design.
        </p>

        <p>
            Different CSS files were used for different pages to demonstrate flexibility in
            design. For example, the video demonstration page focuses on media content, while
            the site report page uses a more text-based layout for readability.

        <h2>Validation and Video Demonstration</h2>
        <p>
            All HTML and CSS files were tested using online validation tools to ensure there
            were no errors. Screenshots of the validation results are included below as
            evidence of valid code.
