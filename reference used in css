 The following parts of the CSS were adapted from the W3Schools mobile navigation example:

Lines defining #menu-toggle { display: none; }
Used to hide the checkbox input that controls the hamburger menu toggle.

Lines defining .hamburger and .hamburger span
Used to visually create the hamburger icon consisting of three horizontal bars.

Media query @media (max-width: 768px)
Used to switch the navigation layout from horizontal to vertical for mobile devices.

CSS selector #menu-toggle:checked + .hamburger + nav ul
Used to expand the navigation menu by increasing max-height when the hamburger icon is clicked.

These lines appear in the following files:
index.css, project.css, sitereport.css, contact.css, and video.css, where the same navigation structure is reused for consistency across the website.
